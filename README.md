# Counter_App
Counter app made using Kotlin.

Counter App by Himanshu:

Problem Statement: There is an absence of a digital app with an extremely simple UI in the life of old people for counting purposes while reciting god’s name on day to day basis.

Proposed Solutions with Screenshots: Using this app, these old people can make use of this counter app with easy to understand UI and implement it with just a tap for their daily use of recitation purposes.

Functionality and Concepts Used: Functions include that with every click on the ‘CLICK ME’ button the designated number gets incremented by 1 and printed on the screen for counting purposes. Concepts like various designing and frontend techniques have been used to design the whole app while in the backend the code runs to increment and print the number on clicks with every click of the ‘CLICK ME’ button.

Application Link and Future Scopes:This app can be further developed to include more beautiful and easy UI and frontend. Also, various other basic day to day useful apps can be added to make an all in one app.
